## Files

To use the R code one has to uncompress the dataset and place it in the parent folder of Current Working Directory. It can be easily changed in line 9.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data.
